    "\n",
    "2. After identifying SV algo draws tangent(line that touches point). It passes through the nearest points from each class; to the hyperplane. The angle between these nearest points and the hyperplane is 90Â°. These points are referred to as Support Vectors. \n",

    "\n",
    "3. A straight line dividing the regions/graphs are known as Hyperplanes. This line is dicided in such a way that the distance bw the line and both the tangents should be maximum in distance. This distance is known as margin. So a hyperplane is placed in such a way that max margin is achieved on support vectors."
